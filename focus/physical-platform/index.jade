p Our aim is co-operation with producers and consumers to provide certainty, continuity and stability for their energy requirements. In gas and power this means managing price and volume risk on very short timescales on a continuous basis.

p In Europe, TrailStone offers a platform to operate, trade and schedule physical electricity and gas assets. With teams working in our offices in London and Berlin we operate 24 hours a day and 7 days a week, focusing on all aspects of managing risk inherent in the physical power and gas markets. Our European team has experience and a proven track record in managing variable volumes, volatile prices or uncertain balancing charges.

p This capability will broadened globally with the launch of power and gas market coverage in North America in 2014.

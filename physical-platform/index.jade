p TrailStone focuses on being an asset-backed commodity logistics company. Significant commercial optimization can be achieved when production assets are paired with storage, transportation and demand. Thus TrailStone will invest directly through asset ownership, partnership or lease in the delivery system of commodities, focusing in particular on power plants, processing plants, refineries, shipping, rail, pipeline and transmission capacity, terminals and storage. Our main geographic focus for the energy markets will be in the Americas and Europe; for metals and mining we will also focus on Asia and parts of Africa.

p The discovery of unconventional oil and natural gas fields in North America has had a major impact on supply import/export dynamics, locational price differentials, and the shape of the financial markets for the natural gas and power markets. The downsizing of investment bank participation in trading, market making and credit intermediation has significantly decreased liquidity in these markets. Managing assets  has never been more challenging. Our US team has a proven track record in managing variable volumes, volatile prices and hedging requirements.
